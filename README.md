## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: As the database to store book information.
- **Express.js**: As the backend framework to manage routes and business logic.
- **Vite.js**: As As the build tool and dev server for the frontend.
- **React.js**: As the frontend library to create interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: As the runtime environment to run the backend server.
- **TailwindCSS**: As the simple CSS for responsive and appealing design.
- **Axios**: As the library for making HTTP requests from frontend to backend.
